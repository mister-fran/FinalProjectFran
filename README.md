# Master Thesis: Angular Reconstruction of High Energy Neutrino Events in IceCube using Machine Learning

**Author**: Luc Voorend  
**Thesis Date**: May 20, 2025  
**Code base language**: Python üêç
## üßä Overview

Welcome! This repository hosts the complete codebase for my Master's thesis. The core focus is developing and evaluating a **transformer-based machine learning model** for reconstructing the arrival direction (angular reconstruction) of high-energy neutrino events detected by the **IceCube Neutrino Observatory** at the South Pole.

### üåå Motivation: Unveiling the High-Energy Universe

Physics has made incredible strides with the **Standard Model** ‚öõÔ∏è, but the universe still holds many mysteries, especially where particle physics meets astrophysics. Understanding extreme cosmic events requires deciphering high-energy particle interactions. While we detect particles from powerful cosmic accelerators, their origins remain largely unknown.

Enter the **neutrino** üëª ‚Äì the elusive "*ghost particle*". With almost no mass and no charge, neutrinos travel billions of light-years unimpeded, carrying direct information from their sources. Unlike Œ≥-rays or cosmic rays, they aren't easily absorbed or deflected. This makes them perfect messengers for multi-messenger astronomy. The **IceCube Observatory** was built precisely for this, aiming to map the high-energy neutrino sky and has already linked neutrinos to distant cosmic sources.

### üéØ The Challenge: Pinpointing Neutrino Sources

Identifying specific neutrino sources requires *excellent angular resolution*. IceCube primarily uses muon neutrinos ($\mu_\nu$) for their track-like signatures.
* **Traditional Methods:** Likelihood-based techniques achieve good resolution (e.g., ‚â≤ 1¬∞ at TeV) but are computationally *slow*.
* **Machine Learning:** GNNs showed promise for speed but haven't consistently beaten traditional methods at high energies (> GeV). The 2023 IceCube Kaggle competition put the spotlight on the potential of **transformers**.

### ‚ú® This Project: Transformers & PMT-fication

This thesis leverages these recent advancements, introducing a novel approach called **PMT-fication** (aggregating detector pulses at the Photomultiplier Tube level) to optimize data for a **transformer model**. The code for PMT-fication is released as a separate toolkit [IcePACK](https://github.com/KUcyans/IcePack/tree/main) The key goals of the thesis were:

* üß† Develop a transformer capable of reconstructing muon neutrino tracks (100 GeV - 100 PeV).
* üî¨ Investigate how factors like *event selection*, *model size*, *training data size*, and *input representation* (PMT-fication) affect performance.
* üìà Compare the final model's angular resolution against the state-of-the-art **SplineMPE** likelihood method.

Ultimately, this repository aims to share these findings and provide a **reproducible and extendable** codebase for future research in neutrino astronomy.
